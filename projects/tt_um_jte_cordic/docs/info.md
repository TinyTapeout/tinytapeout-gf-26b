## How it works

This project computes the **sine and cosine** of an input angle using an iterative
**CORDIC** (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) algorithm.

The angle is supplied as a 7-bit value on `ui[6:0]`, where `0`–`127` maps linearly to
`0°`–`360°` (so each step is `360 / 128 ≈ 2.81°`). Asserting `start` on `ui[7]` begins a
computation.

Internally the design works in **Q2.6 fixed-point** (8-bit two's-complement, where
`1.0 = 64 = 0x40`):

1. **Quadrant fold** — the angle is reduced to the first quadrant (0°–90°), and per-quadrant
   sign flags are recorded so the result can be reflected back into the correct quadrant.
2. **Rotation** — a vector is pre-scaled by the CORDIC gain (`1/K ≈ 0.607`) and rotated through
   **8 fixed micro-rotations** of `arctan(2^-i)`, each taken from a small lookup table. A small
   FSM (`IDLE → LOAD → 8× COMPUTE → DONE`) sequences the iterations; each iteration drives a
   residual-angle accumulator toward zero while the vector's X and Y components converge to
   `cos` and `sin`.
3. **Sign correction** — the recorded quadrant flags are applied, producing the final signed
   `sin` and `cos`.

A result is ready roughly **11 clock cycles** after `start` is asserted. `start` is a level:
hold it high to recompute continuously, release it to freeze and hold the last result.

The outputs are 8-bit two's-complement Q2.6 values:

| Raw (hex) | Decimal | Real value |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| `0x40`    | +64     | +1.0       |
| `0x00`    | 0       | 0.0        |
| `0xC0`    | −64     | −1.0       |

(Convert any output to its real value with `raw / 64`.)

`sin` appears on `uo[7:0]`, `cos` on `uio[7:0]` (the bidirectional pins, configured as outputs).

## How to test

1. Put a 7-bit angle on `ui[6:0]` (0–127 = 0°–360°).
2. Drive `start` (`ui[7]`) high to trigger a computation, then low to latch the result.
3. After ~11 clock cycles, read `sin` on `uo[7:0]` and `cos` on `uio[7:0]`. Interpret both as
   signed Q2.6 (`value = raw / 64`).

Example angles (input code → angle → expected outputs):

| `ui[6:0]` | Angle | `sin` (uo) | `cos` (uio) |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| 0         | 0°    | `0x00` (0)    | `0x40` (+1.0) |
| 16        | 45°   | `0x2E` (≈0.72)| `0x2C` (≈0.69) |
| 32        | 90°   | `0x41` (≈+1.0)| `0x01` (≈0)   |
| 64        | 180°  | `0x00` (≈0)   | `0xC0` (−1.0) |
| 96        | 270°  | `0xBF` (≈−1.0)| `0x01` (≈0)   |

Outputs are within ±a few LSB of the ideal due to the 8-iteration, 8-bit fixed-point
approximation. The included cocotb test (`test/test.py`) sweeps all 128 angles and checks
them bit-exactly against a golden CORDIC model.

## External hardware

No external hardware is required to *drive* the design — the angle and `start` come from the
demo board's input switches.

To *view* the outputs:
- **`sin`** is on `uo[7:0]`, which drives the demo board's 8 on-board LEDs directly.
- **`cos`** is on `uio[7:0]` (the bidirectional/PMOD pins). To see it, attach an **8-bit LED
  PMOD** (or any 8-LED breakout) to the `uio` header. This is optional — `cos` is still
  readable via the RP2040/test harness without it.
